# AI Memory Protocol

Read `.ai/memory/INDEX.md` FIRST at the start of every session — before any other action.

Never assume phase status or file contents from conversation history. Read the actual file.

## Memory structure
- `.ai/memory/INDEX.md` — phase status and links to all memory files
- `.ai/memory/context/` — requirements, optional domain language, tech stack, non-functional
- `.ai/memory/architecture/` — module map, API contracts, ADRs
- `.ai/memory/handoffs/` — phase-to-phase transfer notes
- `.ai/memory/patterns/` — solutions and anti-patterns

## Rules
1. Read INDEX.md first. State the current phase and status before doing any work.
2. After writing any memory file, read it back immediately to confirm correct content.
3. Do not report a phase complete until you have read back the updated INDEX.md.
4. Do not infer file state from conversation — read the file.
